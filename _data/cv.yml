        - title: Effects of Prior Information on Biological Motion Perception
          contents:
            - Designed and implemented an EEG experiment. Collected EEG data from over 30 participants and trained interns on EEG and behavioral data collection.
            - Analyzed EEG data using univariate and multivariate techniques such as temporal decoding and temporal generalization with MNE-Python.
        - title: Temporal Characteristics of Agent Perception
          contents:
            - Explored the interaction of prior and visual information on the temporal dimension of agent perception using RSA and multiple linear regression on EEG data.
