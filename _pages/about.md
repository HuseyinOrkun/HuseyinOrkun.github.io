Hey there! It's great to meet you. My name is HÃ¼seyin Elmas, and I'm a PhD candidate at the Donders Center for Cognition, Sensorimotor Neuroscience. 

I'm originally from Ankara, Turkey, where I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Master's in Neuroscience at Bilkent University. My research focuses on the intriguing relationship between biological motion perception and predictive processing. I love using EEG and behavioral techniques to explore how our prior knowledge shapes how we perceive biological motion.

Currently, I'm pursuing research at the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience (DCC) under the expert guidance of Dr. Luke Miller and Prof. Pieter Medendorp. My main area of interest is gaining a better understanding of the neurocomputational mechanisms involved in mapping tactile input to external space. I'm particularly interested in studying how the brain processes, represents, and transforms tactile information, together with visual and proprioceptive information. I'm also fascinated with the role of uncertainty in sensory processing, how the brain uses probabilistic inference to make predictions about the world, and creating computational and mechanistic models of these processes.

When I'm not working on my research, I enjoy spending time outdoors, watching theater performances, and listening to music. Recently, I've also started bouldering and I find it challenging yet rewarding. I also love the problem-solving aspect of it. Besides that, I'm teaching myself to play the guitar. Although I'm still a beginner, I'm improving!

If you share my fascination with neuroscience, enjoy the outdoors, or have a passion for bouldering, I would be thrilled to connect with you. Please feel free to reach out to me anytime!
