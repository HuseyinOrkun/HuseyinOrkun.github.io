Hello, I am Hüseyin, a PhD studcandidate at the Donders Center for Cognition, specializing in Sensorimotor Neuroscience. My academic journey began in Ankara, Turkey, where I completed my Master's degree in neuroscience at Bilkent University with Burcu Aysen Urgen. My research there delved into the relationship between biological motion perception and predictive processing, employing EEG and behavioral techniques to understand how prior knowledge shapes our perception of biological motion.

Currently, at DCC, together with Dr. Luke Miller and Prof. Pieter Medendorp, my research aims to understand the neurocomputational processes involved in mapping tactile sensations in external space, and the neural mechanisms driving these computations.

In the world outside my research, I have a bunch of hobbies that keep me balanced. I really enjoy getting outdoors. And then there’s theater and music; It’s amazing how a great performance can just lift your spirits.

I’ve also started bouldering recently. It’s tough but super rewarding, especially when you finally send that climb you’ve been struggling with. I’m teaching myself to play the guitar. I’m still a very big beginner, but I’m improving.

If you share a fascination with the wonders of neuroscience or find joy in the outdoors and artistic expressions, I would be delighted to connect and explore these shared interests.
