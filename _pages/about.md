Hey there! It's great to meet you. My name is HÃ¼seyin Elmas, and I'm a PhD candidate at the Donders Center for Cognition, Sensorimotor Neuroscience. 

Currently, I'm working at the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience (DCC) under Dr. Luke Miller and Prof. Pieter Medendorp. My main area of interest is neurocomputational mechanisms involved in mapping tactile input from skin to external space. I'm particularly interested in studying how we represent, and transform tactile information with visual and proprioceptive information. I'm also interested in the role of uncertainty in sensory processing, how the brain uses probabilistic inference to make predictions about the world, and creating computational and mechanistic models of these processes.

I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Master's in Neuroscience at Bilkent University. My research focused on the relationship between biological motion perception and predictive processing. I used EEG and behavioral techniques to explore how our prior knowledge shapes how we perceive biological motion.

Other than research, I enjoy spending time outdoors, watching films, and listening to music. Recently, I've also started bouldering, I also love the kinesthetic, bodily problem-solving aspect of it. Besides that, I'm teaching myself to play the guitar. Although I'm still a beginner!

Please feel free to reach out to me anytime!
